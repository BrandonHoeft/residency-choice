# residency-choice
A friend completed interviewing for med school. I have obtained the data I asked them to track daily about their feelings on rank preference. The goal is to help provide them insight into understanding the center and spread of their preferences, as well as identify if there are any trends over time from ruminating on their residency choice for over a 30 day period.
